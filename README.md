# Adobe-Photoshop-art-layers-separator

This project is based on the original
**photoshopCompositionComposer** by Mateusz Zawartka.

The codebase has been significantly refactored and extended
to support recursive layer traversal, flat ArtLayer collection,
and custom layer path naming to separate each layer to own .png/.psd file.
